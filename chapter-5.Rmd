# 5.1 Introduction
All dplyr functions have a similar process. Data frames are their inputs and outputs, while a given function, such as filter, arrange, select, mutate, or summarise, will conduct some action to change from the input data frame to the output.

# 5.2 Filter rows
> `filter()` : subset observations based on their values

```{r}
(christmas_flights <- filter(flights, month == 12, day == 25))
```

##Comparison operators: 

`>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`, `!=`, `==`

##Logical operators:

- `&` ('and')
- `|` ('or')
- `!` ('not')

    \*`!(x & y)` is the same as `!x | !y` ; `!(x | y)` is the same as `!x & !y`


    \*These are not the same as `&&` and `||`
